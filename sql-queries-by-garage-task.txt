1. get all statuses, not repeating, alphabetically ordered
	
	SELECT DISTINCT status FROM tasks

2. get the count of all tasks in each project, order by tasks count descending
	
	SELECT p.id, p.name, COUNT(t.id) as 'task count' FROM projects AS p LEFT JOIN tasks AS t ON p.id = t.project_id GROUP BY t.project_id ORDER BY COUNT(t.id) DESC 

3. get the count of all tasks in each project, order by projects names
	
	SELECT p.id, p.name, COUNT(t.id) as 'task count' FROM projects AS p LEFT JOIN tasks AS t ON p.id = t.project_id GROUP BY t.project_id ORDER BY p.name 

4. get the tasks for all projects having the name beginning with “N” letter	
	
	SELECT t.name as 'task name', p.name as 'proj. name' FROM projects p LEFT JOIN tasks t ON p.id = t.project_id WHERE p.name LIKE 'N%'

5. get the list of all projects containing the ‘a’ letter in the middle of the name, and
show the tasks count near each project. Mention that there can exist projects without
tasks and tasks with project_id=NULL	// remark: for this task we need use FULL OUTER JOIN, but in mysql -> UNION ALL
	
	SELECT p.name as 'proj. name', COUNT(t.id) as 'task count' FROM projects p LEFT JOIN tasks t ON p.id = t.project_id WHERE p.name LIKE '_%a%_' GROUP BY p.id UNION ALL SELECT 'task without proj', COUNT(t.id) as 'task count' FROM tasks t WHERE t.project_id IS NULL GROUP BY t.project_id  

6. get the list of tasks with duplicate names. Order alphabetically 
	
	SELECT name, COUNT(*) FROM tasks GROUP by name HAVING COUNT(*) > 1 

7. get the list of tasks having several exact matches of both name and status, from
the project ‘Garage’. Order by matches count // remark: absolutely don't understand what do you mean "several exact matches of both name and status", how could it happen

	SELECT t.name FROM projects p LEFT JOIN tasks t ON p.id = t.project_id WHERE p.name = 'Garage' AND t.status = 1 AND (t.name LIKE '%done%' OR t.name LIKE '%completed%')

	SELECT p.name, COUNT(t.id) FROM projects p LEFT JOIN tasks t ON p.id = t.project_id WHERE p.name = 'Garage' AND t.status = 1 AND (p.name LIKE '%done%' OR p.name LIKE '%completed%') GROUP BY p.id ORDER BY COUNT(t.id)

8. get the list of project names having more than 10 tasks in status ‘completed’. Order
by project_id

	SELECT p.name, COUNT(t.id) FROM projects p LEFT JOIN tasks t ON p.id = t.project_id WHERE t.status = 1 GROUP BY p.id HAVING COUNT(t.id) > 10 ORDER BY p.id
